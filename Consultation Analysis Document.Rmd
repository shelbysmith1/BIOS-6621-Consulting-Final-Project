## Outline

# Power Calculation
After Office Hours on Friday, we can use the Confidence Interval given in the paper to reverse engineer a standard deviation estimate for our power calculation
- Similar to HW 12, but not quite as complicated since we've been given this confidence interval, and don't have to just work off of a p-value

# EDA of Preliminary Data

# Correlation of Sodium Intake & Systolic Blood Pressure -- is it actually correlated?
